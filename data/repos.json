Benchmarks show that it is a fair bit faster, and a lot less memory churn.\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKU65ctSM7wll5BABmK6RNhyiPRDdqFg5ofjiJLYBoE/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKU65ctSM7wll5BABmK6RNhyiPRDdqFg5ofjiJLYBoE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/202877/54208671-c720c280-44f5-11e9-9e7d-ada1040af26d.png\" alt=\"Benchmarks\" /></p>\n\n<p>I created a script that used the various LRU implementations to cache &ldquo;Count&rdquo; 8-byte keys, and then asked go runtime to tell me things like how long it took and how much memory was being consumed.\nThere were 2 main tests:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Inserting 1M,2M,5M,10M keys into a cache with 1M slots. This tests just insert performance when things are being excised as fast as they are being inserted. It also tests total memory consumption.</li>\n<li>Creating a cache of size 1/2/5/10M and then inserting twice as many keys. This tests how memory scales when you have a larger cache.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some interesting datapoints from the benchmarking</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Prealloc has a larger effect across the board than I expected. I had thought that things like inserting 10x the keys into a 1M buffer would result in the time not mattering (the buffer fills after the first 1M keys, and from then on the rest of the inserts don&rsquo;t reallocate memory). It is plausible that this is just the initial offset, as the slow doesn&rsquo;t seem dramatically affected. (it adds about 300ms to not prealloc but the test itself finishes in about 900ms worst case).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>TotalAlloc of Intern (old and new) and the new LRU are way better than previous, and better than Hashicorps implementation. At small numbers, Hashicorp never reallocs, so 1M into 1M cache looks better. But Juju <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> allocate on every Add() which scales much better.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Final HeapInUse is a bit noisy, I think this is dependent on how we trigger GC, as it seems surprising that 5M keys into a 1M cache, would use more memory than 10M keys into a 1M cache. The big win for HeapInUse is Prealloc, and the new LRU implementation that uses a fixed buffer, instead of a <code>list.List</code> and a map to <code>*list.Element</code>. &ldquo;master lru&rdquo; had better time performance on large number of keys, because it avoided one of the dereference operations (simplelru points at a list.Element, and then has to get to list.Element.Values.value.) Also the extra alloc for every new Add() having to create an &lsquo;element&rsquo; struct to put in the Values interface. However, master lru used quite a bit more memory, because its &lsquo;complex&rsquo; struct was saved in the map, which means that the empty slots the map preallocates were large, rather than just a simple pointer. The new implementation uses a uint32 and then the large structs are just stored in a compact array.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>For the use case of caching strings, Intern dominates all the LRU implementations (memory, speed, etc). Probably because it doesn&rsquo;t indirect via interface{}? And it certainly can have fewer pointers overall (doesn&rsquo;t need a key pointer, etc.)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The fixed size buffer is both faster and consumes less memory, which is nice. I had been worried that updating the linked list would be faster with pointers, but I suppose if you have to page in a different set of memory, it is the same cost, and this way the memory is more compact, so there is less overall paging.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Prealloc is so much faster, I might just make it the standard behavior and remove dynamic memory allocation. If you size the cache correctly, it will all be in use anyway.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The new code does allocate more total memory if you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> prealloc, then the old code did for Intern. This may be a case of &lsquo;realloc()&rsquo; needing more memory for a brief period of time, and golang maps being more efficient at growing organically. But with prealloc, we improve that dramatically.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

From this release onwards, dual-stack along with the respective CIDR configuration can be easily setup with launch configurations even at install time.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more on dual stack over at:\n- <a href=\"https://microk8s.io/docs/explain-dual-stack\">https://microk8s.io/docs/explain-dual-stack</a>\n- <a href=\"https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-dual-stack\">https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-dual-stack</a></p>\n\n<h3>Improve security and CIS compliance</h3>\n\n<p>Full CIS compliance can be achieved with a single call: <code>microk8s enable cis-hardening</code>. For auditors and those interested in what each CIS recommendation is about we have assembled a detailed list of each recommendation and how we comply with it. Some of the CIS hardening suggestions have been adopted as default setup options in MicroK8s, for example the authentication of users is now done via x509 certificates instead of tokens.</p>\n\n<p>For the work on this feature you can read:\n- <a href=\"https://microk8s.io/docs/cis-compliance\">https://microk8s.io/docs/cis-compliance</a>\n- <a href=\"https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-cis-harden\">https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-cis-harden</a></p>\n\n<h3>Ceph and MicroK8s</h3>\n\n<p>Try this <code>microk8s enable rook-ceph</code> to get the <a href=\"https://rook.io/\">Rook Ceph</a> operator on your cluster. We found that pairing <a href=\"https://canonical-microceph.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/\">MicroCeph</a>, the low ops Ceph distribution, with MicroK8s produces a great setup in terms of feature richenss, stability and effectiveness. In our docs we have a <a href=\"https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-ceph\">guide</a> showing how to testdirve this combination on a single node cluster.</p>\n\n<p>Read more at:\n- <a href=\"https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-ceph\">https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-ceph</a>\n- <a href=\"https://canonical-microceph.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/\">https://canonical-microceph.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/</a>\n- <a href=\"https://rook.io/\">https://rook.io/</a></p>\n\n<h3>New partner joining our addons ecosystem</h3>\n\n<p>Two addons joined our ecosystems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://kubearmor.io/\">KubeArmor</a> is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that restricts the behavior (such as process execution, file access, and networking operations) of pods, containers, and nodes at the system level.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://microcks.io/\">MICROCKS</a> is a CNCF project designed to simplify and streamline API mocking and testing, with support for many different types of API and integrations for GitHub, Gitlab, Jenkins and more.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Detail list of updates since last release</h2>\n\n<h3>Kubernetes core services</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Kubernetes v1.28</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Calico CNI updated to v3.25.1</p>\n\n<h3>Usability Improvements</h3></li>\n\n<li><p><code>microk8s status</code> will return an error code in case the cluster is not yet ready.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><code>microk8s join</code> no longer fails if nodes cannot resolve each other’s hostnames.
